# Ant-Simulation
A simple ant simulation: the ants try to find food (green) and bring it back to their home. They find good paths using trails of pheremones (blue and red), which indicate 'leaving home' and 'returning from food'.<br>
You can left-click drag to draw in new parts of the map and watch the ants try to adapt (hold shift to erase walls instead). The ants' behaviour can also be tweaked on the Settings object.<br>
The project should be opened in the Unity editor (2021.3).

You can watch a video about this project (and some other things) [here](https://youtu.be/X-iSQQgOd1A).<br>
It was inspired by [this video](https://youtu.be/81GQNPJip2Y) by Pezza, who has a much cooler project to experiment with [over here](https://github.com/johnBuffer/AntSimulator).
